# 🧵 Why my extensions don't works?

Eureka is the glue that makes it all work by independently implementing a Scratch extension loading system in a non-sandboxed environment. But Eureka doesn't completely eliminate the problems that come with different environments - as a prime example, the extension tries to read either a vm or a blocks instance. If your extension doesn't work, check to see if the extension modifies something specific to the Scratch mod, and try to report it to the extension's author.

# 📦 Installation

1. Install UserScript Manager like Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey.
2. Install Eureka from [Github Releases](https://github.com/EurekaScratch/eureka/releases).
3. Enjoy!!
